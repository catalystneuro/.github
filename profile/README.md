# Data engineering for neuroscience labs 🧠
Neuroscience data is becoming larger and more complex everyday. The data we collect and the software we write can often be valuable outside the scope of the original project, and should be shared as public resources for the neuroscience community, but this is often a high bar for neuroscience labs to acheive on their own. While the benefits of sharing data and software are clear, it can be difficult for neroscientists to handle the data engineering challenges while focusing on the science.

We integrate with BRAIN Initiative-funded neuroinformatics projects such as the [Neurodata Without Borders](http://nwb.org) data standard and the [DANDI Archive](http://dandiarchive.org) to help labs adopt these tools. Our goal is to help labs share their data and software easily and effectively, and to facilitate secondary analysis of these datasets to accelerate the rate of scientific discovery. We believe that effective packaging and sharing of data and software will lead to new scientific workflows that build upon and combine existing studies, enabling rapidly upon existing knowledge to expand the field towards deeper understanding of the brain and more rapid discovery of treatment for neurological disorders.

## About Us 🧑‍💻
[CatalystNeuro](http://catalystneuro.com) is a software consulting company that specializes in data engineering for neuroscience labs. We are a globally distributed team of neuroscientists who are also software developers, and we care deeply about helping neuroscience adopt state-of-the-art data engineering tools. We excel at helping data infrastructure tools with outreach and with helping neuroscience labs adopt data infrastructure tools, bridging the gap between developers and users. See our team [here](https://www.catalystneuro.com/team/).

## Key Software Projects 📈
* [NeuroConv](https://github.com/catalystneuro/neuroconv) automates conversion of data from common formats into the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) format for distribution on the DANDI Archive.
* [NWBWidgets](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwbwidgets) provides automatic, interactive visualizations of the data within NWB files that are scalable and integrated with the DANDI Archive.
* [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeinterface) is a community-driven unified framework for spike sorting.
